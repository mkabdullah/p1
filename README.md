## Description

This is my first project for the course CSCI E-15 Dymanic Web Applications. The goals of this project include setting up a portfolio to present all of my projects that I will do for this course, and showing that my Git and server workflow is working properly. The project is hosted on a Digital Ocean LAMP machine.
